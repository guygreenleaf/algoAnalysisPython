Python script to analyze a few different algorithms.

This was developed in: 

PyCharm 2020.3.3 (Professional Edition)
Build #PY-203.7148.72
Runtime version: 11.0.9.1+11-b1145.77 aarch64
VM: OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM by JetBrains s.r.o.

with Python 3.9 using matplotlib on an M1 Mac Mini running macOS 11.2.

I noticed that trying to run this on my Macbook Pro using the Community Edition of Pycharm resulted in 
needing to close each graph generated by matplotlib before the program continues.  Not sure if this was just a setting I had wrong on 
that particular machine, but it runs on my Mac Mini and Windows 10 machines with Python 3.9 with normal behavior and all 
graphs are able to be subsequently generated without closing each to continue.

Everything is contained in main.py. The user can simply run main.py to 
access the program menu. Relevant graphs are sent to the SciView viewer.
